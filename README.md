# DhEvasiveFire

For demon hunter. Makes evasive fire easier when used in combination with strafe e.g. for the Advanced Natalya's 2.2 guide.

Usage: Evasive fire needs to be put on right mouse. Move your cursor over the enemy. Hit a button. Your character will use evasive fire then falls back and repeats this two more times. So you will shoot in the direction of your enemies but won't move too close to them.

Turn script on via insert key.
