AutoHotkey scripts for Diablo 3 macros.

# DhEvasiveFire

For: Demon hunter N6.

Summary: Makes evasive fire easier when used in combination with strafe e.g. for a build like the Advanced Natalya's 2.2 guide.

Usage: Strafe needs to be assigned to 1 and evasive fire to right mouse. Hit 1, you will now strafe around (no need for keeping 1 pressed). Move your cursor over the enemy. Hit right mouse. Your character will use evasive fire and then retreats. Macro will repeat this two more times. But you don't need to move your mouse again over the enemy. You will automatically shoow in the direction of your first evasive fire meaning less mouse movement but multiple 2 seconds cdr for rain of vengeance. After macro is done it's time for you to cast RoV then restart it with moving cursor over the enemy and press right mouse.

If you want to cancel the evasive fire loop do a left click.

Turn script off via insert key.
